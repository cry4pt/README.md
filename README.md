- Unusual file operations

| Security Aspect       | Recommendation                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| False Positives       | Whitelist in antivirus        |
| Source Verification   | Review code on GitHub         |
| Safe Alternative      | Use Python version directly   |

### Verification Steps
